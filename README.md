# Brendan Lynn

Hi. My name is Brendan Lynn. I have a website, [here](https://www.brendanlynn.org). I also have a Stack Overflow account, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/22141420/).

I like to work on my own personal projects. The vast majority are public, such as my first real, public GitHub repository, [brandom](https://github.com/brendanlynn/brandom), a CLI for random number generation I developed for my own personal use and wanted to share.

My largest, most advanced, most contributed to repositories are private, however. I sometimes feel an enourmously strong obligation to protect my own intellectual property to the ends of the Earth, and this is one of that feeling's manifestations.
