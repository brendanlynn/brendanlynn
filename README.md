# Brendan Lynn

Hi. My name is Brendan Lynn. I have a website, [here](https://www.brendanlynn.org). I also have a Stack Overflow account, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/22141420/).

I like to work on my own personal projects. Some are public, such as [brandom](https://github.com/brendanlynn/brandom), a CLI for random number generation I recently developed for my own personal use and felt inclined to share.

Most of my repositories are private, however. Most often, I just like to have my own thing.
